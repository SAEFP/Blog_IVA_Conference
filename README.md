The 24th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents was organized in Glasgow between September 16â€“19. Conferences focuses on research including socially interactive agents perceiving the environment and interacting using gestures, facial expressions and speech. It is an interdisciplinary conference bringing together experts from various backgrounds such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, affective computing, human-computer interaction and virtual reality.  I had the opportunity to explore and enhance my knowledge on embodied and conversational agents and different models used for the interaction between the user and the agent. 

My first paper in my PhD was published as an extended abstract titled "Exploring Influence of Social Anxiety on Embodied Face Perception during Affective Social Interactions in VR" in the ACM Digital Library. In our study, we investigate the early face perception of socially anxious individuals using EEG during social interactions with virtual agents in a VR setting. I also gave an oral presentation at the conference and received very valuable feedback from the experts.
